## learn javascript

Try and learn by yourself:

- this keyword:
  refers to some object
  https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp
- Closures: function bundled with references to its surrounding state
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
- node debugging in vscode
- JavaScript was an interpreted language, but since 2009, JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.
- Typescript (highly recommended)

## start the session

- install express
- hello express
- exiting a nodejs program
- reading/setting env vars
